This project requires the Drogon Framework found here - https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon

Most likely you will need vcpkg and Visual Studio (not Visual Studio Code) in order to properly prepare and install Drogon and its dependancies. Be sure you include the lib, bin, and include files of each dependancy and Drogon into your system variables. 

Any questions or help installing Drogon can be directed to Kaiden Joy over Slack
